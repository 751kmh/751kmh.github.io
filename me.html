            name's juan. i also go by 751km/h sometimes
        </p>
        <p>
            made garbage games people barely care about<br>
            thought about becoming an artist at some point but it's hard<br>
            i've done more than that but i'd rather not mention
        </p>
        <p>
            somehow ended up falling in love with a fictional japanese girl with purple hair and a yellow ribbon<br>
            i also like the two sisters surrounded by orb with a single eye<br>
            wolf girl with brown hair is also cute i guess
        </p>
        <p>
            ^^yes i'm a hopeless motherfucker. i do not give a single fuck about my hopelessness
        </p>

            if you see slurs from me or w/e it's just stupid inside joke language from back then.<br>
            despite what i might have said in the past, i don't really have any intentions to actually offend
            people.<br>
            if you're <i>actually</i> offended, then i'm sorry. if you're just upset at slurs, then welcome to the
            internet.
        </p>
        <small>that being said, i don't think i've done any unironic hate speech to any specific group instead of
            <i>"lol funny slur"</i></small>
